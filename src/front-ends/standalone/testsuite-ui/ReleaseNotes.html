    <p> The <a href="http://sbml.org/Software/SBML_Test_Suite">SBML Test Suite</a> 
      allows users and developers to test the degree and correctness of SBML
      support provided in an SBML-compatible software package.  It consists
      of&nbsp;(1) a collection of <a href="http://sbml.org">SBML</a>
      models, each with associated simulation results, and&nbsp;(2) the SBML
      Test Runner, a GUI program for controlling applications to make them
      run through each test case in the suite and report successes and
      failures.  The SBML Test Runner is a Java program that uses the Eclipse
        <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> widget toolkit and can
      be used on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.</p>

    <p> The test cases in the overall Test Suite are divided into 3
      sets: <em>semantic</em>, <em>stochastic</em>, and <em>syntactic</em>. Each
      set is meant to exercise a different aspect of SBML understanding and
      compliance.  The SBML Test Runner currently <strong>only implements facilities
      for running the semantic tests</strong>.  The semantic portion of the Test
      Suite contains valid SBML models with known, deterministic simulation
      results.  These models can be used to test the ability of a software
      system to understand the meaning of different SBML constructs and
      properly simulate the models in a deterministic fashion.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">New in this release:</p>

    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">There is a new installer for Mac
      OS&nbsp;X. The installation is now distributed as an OS&nbsp;X <code>.pkg</code>
      installer file.  By default, it will install the SBML Test Runner into the 
      <code>/Applications</code> folder on the user's computer.</li> 

      <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">This release contains hundreds of new
        semantic test cases, numbers 01219&ndash;1777, written by
        Lucian P. Smith.  They test many more SBML features and
        rules. Important note: tests 01234&#8211;01292 specifically test
        models that follow the release candidate specification of <a
        href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Version_2/Core/Release_1">SBML
        Level 3 Version 2</a>, which encode elements and situations that were not
        present or illegal in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1. If your simulator
        uses libsbml, it will <strong>need the latest experimental version of <a
        href="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a>, 5.14.0 or 
        later</strong>. Please see the file <code>NEWS.html</code> (provided
        with the distribution) for more details about the changes to the test
        cases.</li>  

      <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">The SBML Test Suite home repository has
        been moved to <a
        href="https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite">GitHub</a>. 
        New development will take place in the branch called
        <a href="https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/tree/develop">&#8216;develop&#8217;</a>.
        Each time we make a new release, we will merge the changes into branch
        &#8216;master&#8217; and start the next new developments in
        &#8216;develop&#8217;.</li>

    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Changes in this release:</p>

    <ul>

      <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">A few things have been cleaned up in
      past tests. Examples include model identifiers of a few test models
      that were misleading (now fixed), and a few tests that were designed to
      test species in multiple compartments were at some point accidentally
      changed so that all the species were put into a single compartment
      (they have been redistributed appropriately now).</li> 

      <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">The issue tracker for the Test Suite is now the GitHub tracker: <a
    href="https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/issues">https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/issues</a>. Lucian
        Smith migrated the previous issues from the SourceForce tracker, so
        they are now in the GitHub tracker, for history. We thank the guides
        by <a href="https://github.com/mephenor/JSBML-Migration-Guide/wiki/">Thomas
        Zajac</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cmungall/gosf2github">Chris
        Mungall</a> for helpful info about how to achieve this migration.</li> 

    <li>With the addition of FBC v2 tests, the <code>packagesPresent</code> line in
      the <code>.m</code> file can now include <code>fbc_v1</code> or
      <code>fbc_v2</code>, depending on which version of the test it is.
      The original <code>fbc</code> tag is still present.  In addition,
      a new FBC test tag <code>fbc:NonStrict</code> is now provided for FBC
      v2 models where the <code>strict</code> flag has been set to
        <code>false</code>.</code>
