    <p> The <a href="http://sbml.org/Software/SBML_Test_Suite">SBML Test Suite</a> 
      is a conformance testing system for <a href="http://sbml.org">SBML</a>. 
    It allows users and developers to test the degree and correctness of SBML
    support provided in an SBML-compatible software package.  The SBML Test
      Suite consists of (1) a collection of <a href="http://sbml.org">SBML</a>
    models, each with associated simulation results, and (2) the SBML Test
    Runner, for controlling applications to make them run through each test
      case in the suite and report test successes and failures.  The SBML
      Test Runner is a Java program that uses the Eclipse
      <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> widget toolkit and
      can be used on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.</p>

    <p> The test cases are divided into 3 sets. Each set is meant to exercise
      a different aspect of SBML understanding and
      compliance.  The SBML Test Runner currently only implements facilities
      for running the first kind (semantic):
      <ul>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em"><b>Semantic</b>: The semantic test suite
          contains valid SBML models with known, deterministic simulation
          results.  These models can be used to test the ability of a software
          system to understand the meaning of different SBML constructs and
          properly simulate the models in a deterministic fashion.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em"><b>Stochastic</b>: The stochastic test
          suite contains valid SBML models with known, stochastic simulation
          results.  These tests exercise fewer features of SBML, and are
          instead intended to test the accuracy of systems that employ discrete
          stochastic simulation algorithms.</li>

        <li><b>Syntactic</b>: The syntactic test suite consists of valid and
          invalid SBML models.  Each test is designed to check a particular
          SBML syntactic validation rule defined in the SBML specification
          documents.  Each case model in this part of the Test Suite is
          expected to be recognized by a software system as being either
          valid or invalid &ndash; nothing more.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">New in this release:</p>

    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">New installer for Mac OS&nbsp;X. The installation is now distributed as an OS&nbsp;X <code>.pkg</code> installer file.  It will install the test runner into the user's <code>/Applications</code> folder by default.</li>

      <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">The SBML Test Suite home repository has been moved to GitHub. New development will take place in the branch called &#8216;develop&#8217;: <a href="https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/tree/develop">https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/tree/develop</a> Each time we make a new release, we will merge the changes into branch &#8216;master&#8217; and start the next new developments in &#8216;develop&#8217;.</li>
      <li>New semantic test cases. Note that tests 01234&#8211;01292 specifically test models that follow the release candidate specification of <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Version_2/Core/Release_1">SBML Level 3 Version 2</a>, which encode elements and situations that were not present or illegal in SBML Level 3 Version 1. If your simulator uses libsbml, it will <strong>need the latest experimental version</strong> of <a href="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a>, 5.14.0.<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">All existing tests that could be translated to SBML Level 3 Version 2 (L3V2) now have L3V2 versions.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01219&#8211;01223 test the use of compartment sizes other than <code>1</code> in combination with of species having attribute <code>hasOnlySubstanceUnits</code>=<code>true</code> and various values for attributes <code>initialAmount</code> and <code>initialConcentration</code> in combination with rate rules.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01224&#8211;01233 and 01300&#8211;01306 test the use of a reaction identifier in the MathML of another construct.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01234&#8211;01247, 01271, and 01300&#8211;01306 test simulator robustness to the use of elements without child elements allowed in L3V2 but <em>not</em> in L3V1. This includes <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> children especially, but also things like the <code>&lt;trigger&gt;</code> of events. This is because some things are allowed in L3V2 that were not allowed in lower Level+Version combinations of SBML.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01248&#8211;01270 and 01293&#8211;1299 test the new &#8216;rateOf&#8217; SBML Level 3 Version 2 construct.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01272&#8211;01281 test the new MathML elements: <code>max</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>quotient</code>, and <code>implies</code>, allowed in SBML Level 3 Version 2.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01282&#8211;01292 test the use of Boolean values in numeric contexts, and visa versa.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01307&#8211;01309 are tests where a species in the model is used as an amount, but its output is requested by the test suite in terms of its concentration.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Case 01310 has a compartment with spatialDimensions of 2.7</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01311&#8211;01315 test nested function definitions.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01316&#8211;01322 test csymbols with names that shadow other parameters or functions.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01323 tests that the proper value of Avogadro is being used, when compared to all historical values of Avogadro.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01324&#8211;01338 test various event semantics, including simultaneous and delayed events.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01339&#8211;01340 test reactions whose rate changes between being negative and being positive.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01341&#8211;01342 test the existence of a compartment, species, and nothing else.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Case 01343 tests the &#8216;tanh&#8217; MathML function.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01344&#8211;01394 test hierarchical models where the IDs of replaced elements in submodels are used in math in those submodels, including dependency chains across parent/child boundaries.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Case 01395 is a huge model where it can make a difference if the rules are not re-ordered.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01396&#8211;99 test combinations of &#8216;fast&#8217; reactions with assigned stoichiometries and local parameters.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1ex">Cases 01400&#8211;01419 test the &#8216;rateOf&#8217; and &#8216;delay&#8217; csymbols in combination with each other and with various other tests.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Cases 01420&#8211;01453 test single reactions that have multiple speciesReferences that all point to the same species.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Changes in this release:</p>

    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">A few things have been cleaned up in past tests. Examples include model identifiers of a few test models that were misleading (now fixed), and a few tests that were designed to test species in multiple compartments were at some point accidentally changed so that all the species were put into a single compartment (they have been redistributed appropriately now).</li>
      <li>The issue tracker for the Test Suite is now the GitHub tracker: <a href="https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/issues">https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/issues</a>. Lucian Smith migrated the previous issues from the SourceForce tracker, so they are now in the GitHub tracker, for history. We thank the guides by <a href="https://github.com/mephenor/JSBML-Migration-Guide/wiki/">Thomas Zajac</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cmungall/gosf2github">Chris Mungall</a> for helpful info about how to achieve this migration.</li>
